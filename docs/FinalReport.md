## CRAP Principles

### Contrast

Contrasting three-part color pallete used, desaturated lime for background, wide spectrum of amber for foreground, indigo for accent, zinc(gray) for navbar and buttons.

### Repetition

Reused navbar, button style, item list layout in shop page, ect.

### Alignment

Inverted pyramid layout that settles into straight alignment in hero page, all pages uses generous horizontal padding for content with the exception of the navbar, ect.

### Proximity

Item list, Cart, home page boxes, navbar links, ect.



## Metrics:

### Desktop results:

![Desktop-metrics](img/desk-ins.png)

Performance seems to marginally suffer, likely due to usage of some outdated practices, and heavy realiance on data fetching from Firebase. Other metrics seem to be at an acceptable level.



### Mobile results:

![Mobile-metrics](img/mob-ins.png)

Significant preformance drop when switching to mobile, other metrics are mostly unchanged.



## Summary:

Several UI and logic bugs present, difficult to eliminate. Performance and functionality have room for improvement. As a proof of concept for a webshop with a focus on UI design, the project is adequate. Harmonious color pallete, unique fonts, and adherence to CRAP principles makes the website appealing to potential customers.
