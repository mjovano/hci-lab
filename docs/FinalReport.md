## Metrics:

### Desktop results:

![Desktop-metrics](img/desk-ins.png)

Performance seems to marginally suffer, likely due to usage of some outdated practices, and heavy realiance on data fetching from Firebase. Other metrics seem to be at an acceptable level.



### Mobile results:

Significant preformance drop when switching to mobile, other metrics are mostly unchanged.

## Summary:

Several UI and logic bugs present, difficult to eliminate. Performance and functionality have room for improvement. As a proof of concept for a webshop with a focus on UI design, the project is adequate. Harmonious color pallete, unique fonts, and adherence to CRAP principles makes the website appealing to potential customers.
